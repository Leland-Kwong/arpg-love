## 2.0.0-alpha

**NOTE:** In order to support the latest changes, we've had to delete your existing saved games. We will continue to do this as necessary until the game has reached a more stable state.

This release adds new major features and fixes a number of high priority bugs around player and ai movement.

New

* New legendary items (drop rates are increased to 10% for testing purposes)
* Boss added (follow the yellow arrow on level 2)
* Dungeons now have levels
* Various HUD updates
* Right-click to equip now automatically equips to the next available slot if available. Otherwise it equips to the first slot that matches that item type.

### Bug Fixes

* Hugging the wall no longer prevents ai from engaging player
* Ai no longer pushes the player through the wall
