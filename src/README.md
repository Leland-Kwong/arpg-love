## Theme
The year is 3219 and we're a multi-planetary species thanks to Elon Musk. Your are a bounty hunter piloting a mech / android to do the hunting. The world is inhabited with new creatures and some have evolved with enhanced powers. Others have learned to harness technology to augment themselves.

## Universal health / mana resource
There is no mana and health. Instead, everything costs energy.

### Lore
The player is equipped with an ion reactor that applies a second skin (nano-particles) to all equipped items. As the player gets hit, the nano particles get damaged, and the ion reactor uses some of its energy to repair the damaged particles.

### Mechanic
Ion generators provide a universal power source called **ion energy**. Ion generators have a maximum storage capacity with built-in regeneration.

Ion generators also have a built-in *ion shield* ability that provides a temporary high-resistance forcefield for a brief moment. Using this ability costs a flat amount of ion and disables ion regeneration for a short duration to balance it out.

All special abilitiies and certain special weapons also cost **ion energy** to use. Ion surge packs may also be used to provide a burst charge to the generator.

The gist: There is only a health bar, and all abilities cost some amount of it.

Additional mechanics
* **energy leech** - some generators and items are able to convert organic and/or inorganic matter into ion energy. This ability acts similarly to life leech in traditional arpgs.

## Currency system
Everything is traded with **scrap metal**. You can also break down items for **scrap metal**.

## Defense types
Damage reduction is applied in the following order:

1. armor percent
2. armor flat
3. resistance percent
4. resistance flat

The reasoning behind this is that resistances can be high percentages, so we want them applied later to have less of an impact on overall damage reduction.

### Armor
Each point of armor provides 0.01% damage reduction and 1 flat damage reduction.

### Resistances
Each percent of resistance reduces damage of that type by an equal percent with a cap at 75%.

## Skill ideas

### Time field
Creates a time field at a location that slows everything (including players) inside it. Also reduces damage dealt by the slow amount (damage is affected by attack velocity?). Upgrading it reduces the slow amount for players.
